# One-Blood

Problem Statement :

Blood donation is a time-consuming process in health care since it takes a long time to identify a donor who is compatible with the patient's blood group. 
We created a blood donation Web app One Blood as a blood bank solution to connect the requester and the donor at any time and from any location. 
This application's goal is to provide information about the requested blood as well as the number of available donors in the area. 
The goal of this research was to create a blood management information system to help with the management of blood donor data and to make/control blood distribution in various parts of the country based on hospital needs.
